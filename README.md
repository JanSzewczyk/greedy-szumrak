## 🎯 Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

#### 1. Fork & clone repository:

```bash
## Don't forget to ⭐ star and fork it first :)
git clone https://github.com/<your_username)/nextjs-szumplate.git
```

#### 2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm ci
```

#### 3. Prepare project:

- To use fully configured [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) feature, go to [`~/.github/workflows/publish.yml`](https://github.com/JanSzewczyk/nextjs-szumplate/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml) file, then expose hidden code (lines from 26 to 30). After that you can enjoy all semantic-release and sharable configuration features (more details [HERE](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@szum-tech/semantic-release-preset)).
- Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your [github actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

#### 4. Run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## 🎨 Styling and Design System

This boilerplate uses Tailwind CSS for styling and [Szum-Tech Design System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@szum-tech/design-system), which contains fully designed components, color palette, utils and more... ([Check DOCS](https://szum-tech-design-system.vercel.app/?path=/docs/introduction--docs))

## 🤖 ChatGPT Code Review

We've integrated the innovative [ChatGPT Code Review](https://github.com/anc95/ChatGPT-CodeReview) for AI-powered, automated code reviews. This feature provides real-time feedback on your code, helping improve code quality and catch potential issues.

To use ChatGPT Code Review, add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with an appropriate key from the OpenAI platform. For setup details, refer to the [Using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/anc95/ChatGPT-CodeReview#using-github-actions) section in the documentation.

## 💻 Environment Variables handling

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of the expected type. You’ll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at [`env.js`](./env.js). Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your project.

```ts
const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    // Server variables
    SECRET_KEY: z.string()
  },
  client: {
    // Client variables
    API_URL: z.string().url()
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    // Assign runtime variables
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
  }
});
```

---

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```shell
  ❌ Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```

## 🚀 Github Actions

Github Actions offer multiple smooth workflows that make development easier and reduce the developer's impact on repetitive and boring tasks.

### Code Review 🤖Flow

For more details, check paragraph [🤖 ChatGPT Code Review](#-chatgpt-code-review).

> Code of this workflow, you can find in [`code-review.yml`](./.github/workflows/code-review.yml) file.

### PR Checks ✅ Flow

This action is used only during pull request life, it validates the added code in terms of its correctness, preventing the merge of incorrect code.

**Checks the code for:**

- Build 🏗
- Prettier 🧹
- Eslint ⬣
- TypeScript 🛠️
- Test 🧪
- Playwright 🎭 (e2e tests)

> Code of this workflow, you can find in [`pr-check.yml`](./.github/workflows/pr-check.yml) file.

### Publish 📦🚀

The action is triggered when a changes are added to the main branch `main`. It uses the [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) library. Based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it determines the next version of the application, boosts it in the [`package.json`](./package.json) file, adds information to the `CHANGELOG.md` file and creates a new [release on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

The configuration used in Szumplate comes from the package [`@szum-tech/semantic-release-preset`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@szum-tech/semantic-release-preset), which contains the shareable configurations used by the Semantic Release.

[Let's see configuration](https://github.com/JanSzewczyk/semantic-release-preset/blob/main/without-npm.js) used in this Repository.

> Code of this workflow, you can find in [`publish.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) file.

## 🔒 Keeping Server-only Code out of the Client Environment

Since JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules, it's possible for code that was only ever intended to be run on the server to sneak its way into the client.
To prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the [`server-only`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.

Then import the package into any module that contains `server-only` code:

```tsx
import "server-only";

// The rest of server only code
```

The corresponding package `client-only` can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code – for example, code that accesses the `window` object.
